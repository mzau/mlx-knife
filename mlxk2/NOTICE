  Note: mlx-audio transitively depends on soundfile (BSD-3-Clause), which
  includes an embedded build of libsndfile (LGPL-2.1-or-later) for audio I/O.
  The embedded library is dynamically loaded via CFFI (permitted under LGPL §6).
  MP3 codec support is provided by the embedded libsndfile without additional
  system dependencies (no ffmpeg or Homebrew required).

  mlx-knife bundles tiktoken vocabulary files (gpt2.tiktoken, multilingual.tiktoken)
  in mlxk2/assets/whisper/ from mlx-audio commit 9349644. These files are used as
  a workaround for mlx-audio Issue #479 (assets removed in f7328a4 but code still
  requires them). Original files are from the OpenAI Whisper model, distributed by
  mlx-audio under the MIT License.

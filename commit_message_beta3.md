Release MLX Knife 1.1.0-beta3 - Critical Bug Fixes & Lock Cleanup Resolution

Major bug fixes addressing cache management and user experience issues:

**Issue #21: Empty Cache Directory Crash - RESOLVED**
- Fix: Added MODEL_CACHE.exists() checks in list_models() function  
- Impact: MLX-Knife now works correctly on fresh installations
- Files: cache_utils.py:459-462, cache_utils.py:478-481
- Test: Added test_list_models_real_empty_cache() regression test

**Issue #22: urllib3 LibreSSL Warning on macOS Python 3.9 - RESOLVED**
- Fix: Central warnings suppression before urllib3 imports
- Impact: Clean output on macOS system Python 3.9 with LibreSSL
- Files: __init__.py:7-9
- Scope: Only affects macOS system Python 3.9

**Issue #23: Double rm Execution Problem - FULLY RESOLVED**
- Problem: `mlxk rm model@hash` required two executions (first left broken state)
- Root Cause: Only deleted snapshots/<hash>, left refs/main pointing to deleted snapshot  
- Fix: Changed to delete entire model directory, not just specific snapshot
- Additional Fix: Corrected lock cleanup path bug discovered during implementation
- Impact: Single execution now completely removes models + cleans orphaned locks
- Files: cache_utils.py (whole model deletion + lock cleanup path correction)
- Tests: Added comprehensive integration tests covering full rm lifecycle

Technical improvements:
- Enhanced test coverage: 140/140 tests passing (up from 137)
- Fixed 3 unit tests broken by lock cleanup path correction
- Improved cache path consistency across all Python versions
- Better error handling for fresh installations and corrupted models
